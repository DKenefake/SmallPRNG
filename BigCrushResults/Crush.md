# TestU01 - Crush 

Crush a testing suite that tests the statistical quality of pseudo random generator algorithms. There are 3 differnt levels of test, 'small crush', 'medium crush' and 'big crush'. I am testing the 32 bit outputs of these generators on a random seed, as well as the bit reversed outputs. I will summarize these in a table as well as include the program outputs in this directory so that you can see what tests were failed.
